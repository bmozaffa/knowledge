# Time in the United States
In the United States, time is divided into nine standard [time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone "Time zone") covering the states, territories and other US possessions, with most of the country observing [daylight saving time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time "Daylight saving time") (DST) for approximately the spring, summer, and fall months. The time zone boundaries and DST observance are regulated by the [Department of Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation "United States Department of Transportation"), but no single map of those existed until the agency announced intentions to make one in September 2022.[^1] Official and highly precise timekeeping services (clocks) are provided by two federal agencies: the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology") (NIST) (an agency of the [Department of Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce "United States Department of Commerce")); and the [United States Naval Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Observatory "United States Naval Observatory") (USNO). The clocks run by these services are kept synchronized with each other as well as with those of other international timekeeping organizations.

It is the combination of the time zone and daylight saving rules, along with the timekeeping services, which determines the legal [civil time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_time "Civil time") for any U.S. location at any moment.

## History
Before the adoption of four [standard time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time "Standard time") zones for the continental United States, many towns and cities set their clocks to noon when the sun passed their local [meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(astronomy) "Meridian (astronomy)"), pre-corrected for the [equation of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time "Equation of time") on the date of observation, to form [local mean solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time#Mean_solar_time "Solar time"). Noon occurred at different times but time differences between distant locations were barely noticeable prior to the 19th century because of long travel times and the lack of long-distance instant communications prior to the development of the telegraph.

The use of [local solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_solar_time "Local solar time") became increasingly awkward as railways and telecommunications improved.[^2] American railroads maintained many different time zones during the late 1800s. Each train station set its own clock making it difficult to coordinate train schedules and confusing passengers. Time calculation became a serious problem for people traveling by train (sometimes hundreds of miles in a day), according to the Library of Congress. Train drivers must recalculate their own clocks in order to know departure time. Every city in the United States used a different time standard so there were more than 300 local sun times to choose from. Time zones were therefore a compromise, relaxing the complex geographic dependence while still allowing local time to be approximate with mean solar time. Railroad managers tried to address the problem by establishing 100 railroad time zones, but this was only a partial solution to the problem.[^2]

Weather service chief [Cleveland Abbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Abbe "Cleveland Abbe") introduced four standard time zones for his weather stations, an idea which he offered to the railroads.[^3] Operators of the new railroad lines needed a new time plan that would offer a uniform train schedule for departures and arrivals. Four standard time zones for the continental United States were introduced at noon on November 18, 1883, in [Chicago, IL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago"), when the telegraph lines transmitted time signals to all major cities.[^4][^5]

In October 1884, the [International Meridian Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Meridian_Conference "International Meridian Conference") at Washington, D.C., decided that the prime meridian for longitude and timekeeping should be one that passes through the center of the transit instrument at the [Greenwich Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich "Royal Observatory, Greenwich") in the United Kingdom. The conference therefore established the [Greenwich Meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian_(Greenwich) "Prime meridian (Greenwich)") as the prime meridian and [Greenwich Mean Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time "Greenwich Mean Time") (GMT) as the world's time standard. The U.S. time-zone system grew from this, in which all zones referred back to GMT on the prime meridian.[^2]

### From GMT to UTC
In 1960, the International Radio Consultative Committee formalized the concept of [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time"), which became the new international civil time standard. UTC is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0°.[^6] UTC does not observe daylight saving time.

For most purposes, UTC is considered interchangeable with GMT, but GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community. UTC is one of several closely related successors to GMT.

## United States and regional time zones
Standard time zones in the United States and other regions are currently defined at the federal level by statute [15 U.S.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_15_of_the_United_States_Code "Title 15 of the United States Code") [§ 260](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/260). The federal law also establishes the transition dates and times at which [daylight saving time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time "Daylight saving time") occurs, with federal law making its observation dependent on state or tribal law. It is ultimately the authority of the [secretary of transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation "United States Secretary of Transportation"), in coordination with the states, to determine which regions will observe which of the standard time zones and if they will observe daylight saving time.[^7] As of August 9, 2007, the standard time zones are defined in terms of hourly offsets from [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time").[^8] Prior to this they were based upon the [mean solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time "Solar time") at several meridians 15° apart west of [Greenwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich "Royal Observatory, Greenwich") ([GMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time "Greenwich Mean Time")).

Only the full-time zone names listed below are official; abbreviations are by common use conventions, and duplicated elsewhere in the world for different time zones.

### Zones used in states beyond the contiguous U.S.
*   [Alaska Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Time_Zone "Alaska Time Zone") ([UTC−09:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9209:00 "UTC−09:00"); Zone V), which comprises most of the state of [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska").
*   [Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii%E2%80%93Aleutian_Time_Zone "Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone") (no daylight saving in Hawaii, [UTC−10:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9210:00 "UTC−10:00"); zone W), which includes [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii") and most of the length of the [Aleutian Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands "Aleutian Islands") chain (west of 169°30′W).

### Zones used in U.S. territories
*   [Samoa Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Time_Zone "Samoa Time Zone") ([UTC−11:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9211:00 "UTC−11:00"); Zone X), which comprises [American Samoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Samoa "American Samoa").
*   [Chamorro Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_Time_Zone "Chamorro Time Zone") ([UTC+10:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B10:00 "UTC+10:00"); Zone K), which comprises [Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam "Guam") and the [Northern Mariana Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands "Northern Mariana Islands").

### Minor Outlying Islands
Some [United States Minor Outlying Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Minor_Outlying_Islands "United States Minor Outlying Islands") are outside the time zones defined by 15 U.S.C. §260 and exist in waters defined by [nautical time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_time "Nautical time"). In practice, military crews may simply use [Zulu time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_time_zones "List of military time zones") ([UTC±00:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%C2%B100:00 "UTC±00:00")) when on these islands. [Baker Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Island "Baker Island") and [Howland Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howland_Island "Howland Island") are in [UTC−12:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9212:00 "UTC−12:00"), while [Wake Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Island "Wake Island") is in [UTC+12:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B12:00 "UTC+12:00"). Because they exist on opposite sides of the [International Date Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line "International Date Line"), it can, for example, be noon Thursday on Baker and Howland islands while simultaneously being noon Friday on Wake Island. Other outlying islands include [Jarvis Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Island "Jarvis Island"), [Midway Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll "Midway Atoll"), [Palmyra Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra_Atoll "Palmyra Atoll"), and [Kingman Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingman_Reef "Kingman Reef") ([UTC−11:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9211:00 "UTC−11:00")); [Johnston Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_Atoll "Johnston Atoll") ([UTC−10:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9210:00 "UTC−10:00")); and [Navassa Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navassa_Island "Navassa Island"), [Bajo Nuevo Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajo_Nuevo_Bank "Bajo Nuevo Bank"), and [Serranilla Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serranilla_Bank "Serranilla Bank") ([UTC−05:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9205:00 "UTC−05:00")).

### Antarctic research stations
See also: [Time in Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Antarctica "Time in Antarctica")
In Antarctica, the U.S. research facility [Palmer Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Station "Palmer Station") is in [UTC−03:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9203:00 "UTC−03:00"), while [McMurdo Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station "McMurdo Station") and [Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott_South_Pole_Station "Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station") use [UTC+12:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B12:00 "UTC+12:00") in order to coordinate with their main supply base in [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand").

*   follows the border between [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California") (west) and Arizona (east), mostly defined by the Colorado River, to the border between the U.S. and Mexico.

## Daylight saving time (DST)
Main article: [Daylight saving time in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_in_the_United_States "Daylight saving time in the United States")

Daylight saving time (DST) begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November.

Clocks are set ahead one hour at 2:00 a.m. on the start date and set back one hour at 2:00 a.m. on the end date.

In response to the [Uniform Time Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Time_Act "Uniform Time Act") of 1966, each state has officially chosen to apply one of two rules over its entire territory:

*   Most use the standard time for their zone (or zones, where a state is divided between two zones), except for using daylight saving time during the summer months. Originally this ran from the last Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October. Two subsequent amendments, in 1986 and 2005, have shifted these days so that daylight saving time now runs from the second Sunday in March until the first Sunday in November.

*   [Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona "Arizona") and [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii") use standard time throughout the year. However:
    *   The [Navajo Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Nation "Navajo Nation") observes DST throughout its entire territory, including the portion that lies in Arizona. But the [Hopi Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_Reservation "Hopi Reservation"), which is [entirely surrounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave "Enclave and exclave") by the Navajo Nation and is entirely in Arizona, does _not_ observe DST. (See map inset right.)
*   In 2005, Indiana passed legislation that took effect on April 2, 2006, that placed the entire state on daylight saving time (see [Time in Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Indiana "Time in Indiana")). Before then, [Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana "Indiana") officially used standard time year-round, with the following exceptions:
    *   The portions of Indiana that were on Central Time observed daylight saving time.
    *   Some Indiana counties near [Cincinnati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati "Cincinnati") and [Louisville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky "Louisville, Kentucky") were on Eastern Time but did (unofficially) observe DST.

The [Energy Policy Act of 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005 "Energy Policy Act of 2005") extended [daylight saving time (DST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time "Daylight saving time") for an additional month beginning in 2007.

The [Sunshine Protection Act of 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Protection_Act "Sunshine Protection Act") passed the United States [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") in March of 2022. The bill would make Daylight Time the time year-round in the entire United States. The bill was not voted on by the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives").[^10]
